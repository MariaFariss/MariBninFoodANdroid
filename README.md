It is an academic projet, an android application done by Kotlin and firestore. 
My application is a recipe sharing platform that allows users to draw inspiration from existing recipes and create their own recipes.
Elaborating further, my application is designed as a user-friendly and interactive platform dedicated to the sharing of culinary recipes. Its main objective is to provide users with a vast collection of pre-existing recipes from various cuisines and cultures from around the world.
Users can easily explore the available recipes, sorted into categories such as main dishes, desserts, appetizers, and more. They can view the required ingredients, detailed preparation steps, and even find tips and variations for each recipe.
In addition to recipe exploration, my application also encourages users to unleash their culinary creativity by allowing them to create their own personalized recipes. They can enter the ingredients, quantities, preparation steps, and even add appealing photos to accompany their creations.
